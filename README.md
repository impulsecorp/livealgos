# livealgos
The world's first live open-source trading algorithm. Use our money to test your automated stock/FX/crypto trading strategies. All changes users make to our Python GitHub code are added to the repo, and then reflected in the live trading account that goes with it. You can also use that same code to trade with your own money. We have spent over 10 years developing automated trading strategies, and are open sourcing all of our programming (meaning it is free for anybody to use) in the hopes that users will help improve it.
